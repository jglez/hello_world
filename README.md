GitHub tutorial

I'm Jorge. Currently, I'm learning the web development discipline with a focus on full-stack development. I am a student at the coding academy Lambda School. So far, I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next, I will be studying the UI library React. I hope to start working on some personal projects on the side of my coursework.
